                    <p>I have always been interested in building things since a young age. I’m pretty sure one of my first words was “ballpeen hammer”. This love of building came from a variety of places. My uncle worked for a construction company and I saw all the cool things he was able to do. Behind my house growing up, there was an empty field that was about to be developed. After the workers had gone home my Grandpa would take me and let me sit in the empty construction vehicles. There was a small post in the unfinished part of our basement which my Dad let me hammer things into. Home Depot was much more fun to go to than Toys R Us.
 					Eventually this love of building led me to Legos. Legos are without a doubt one of the greatest inventions of all time. I could build anything I wanted. This love of Legos led me to local Lego clubs and conventions. My trip to Legoland was the greatest time of my life. Eventually Lego released Lego Mindstorms, a beginner robot building kit. Now my Lego creations could move and make intelligent decisions. However, by about the sixth grade I had reached the limit of Legos.  It was then that I stumbled across the book “Robot Building for Beginners” by David Cook in the library. This book launched me into the larger world of robotics and my love of electronics and programing took off.

                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>Fast forward to today and this love of building and electronics has given me a desire to pursue a major in Computer Engineering at UVA. Electronics are integrated into my everyday life and I want to learn as much about them as I can. There are few things cooler than typing a line of code and having something move or light up, especially when that something is hundreds of miles away and connected only by the Internet. I’ve built many things which are connected together through the Internet, from a desk clock, to a networked Makerbot Replicator 2 3D printer. Both of these projects used a Raspberry pi combined with custom hardware and code.
					I enjoy building and fixing things in my free time and would like to make it a career. Some people may find technical issues frustrating, but I see them as a challenge to overcome. Nothing easy is ever fun or rewarding. From a young age, I have always had a strong interest in electronics. In sixth grade I built my first circuit, and in eighth grade I taught myself how to solder. If something that runs on electricity breaks I will try to fix it. If something does not run on electricity I will try to make it electric. I have done electrical work on everything from computers and phones to houses and cars and would love to turn it into a career.

                            <p>Tassa is a social app which allows groups of friends to find a convenient location to meet. It allows for up to three locations to be entered and it will find places by category that is in between the entered locations. The Android version Tassa was written entirely in Java using Android Studio. The iOS version was written using Xamarin Studio and C#. Tassa uses <a href="https://www.factual.com/"> Factual's API</a> for place search and Google's Places API for the geocoding of addresses.

                            <p>This device enables you to charge cell phones using only a heat source. The picture shows the top of the device where the circuitry lies. The Purple PCB was custom designed by me using Eagle CAD software. It contains a USB charging port to plug phones into, an LED indicator light, and USB Charging circuitry. The red board is a boost regulator. This delivers the required 5V to the USB port, from the ~1V that the Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) generates. A TEC on the bottom produces a heat differential between its two sides when electricity is applied using the Peltier effect. The Seebeck effect is the opposite phenomenon- when a temperature differential exists between the sides of the device, electricity is produced. I use the voltage produced by the Seebeck effect to charge a cell phone. Surrounding the TEC is a heatsink attached to a custom built enclosure. The TEC is attached to the heatsink with thermally conductive glue.</p>

The i7-5820k is cooled by a custom designed and built water-cooling system. It uses a 200mm*200mm radiator mounted to a fan in the front of the case. All the wires are individually sleeved for more pleasing aesthetics and better airflow. The wires are meticulously routed in order to not block the carefully designed airflow path.</p>

                            <p>I was approached by one of my father’s co-workers who is a senior electrical engineer at Lockheed Martin. He knew of my interest and skills in microcontroller programming and circuit design and came to me to solve a complex issue he was having with his HVAC system. His heating system was costing him hundreds of dollars more than he was expecting per month and he needed a way to pinpoint the problem. I built a custom data logger to keep track of all of the activities of the thermostats. It sensed whether or not the heating was on in a particular area of the house by feeding the outputs of the six thermostats into opto-isolated AC to DC converters. Data was displayed on a LCD and logged to an SD card along with the time from a DS1307 RTC and the temperature from certain pipes going into and out of the radiant heat system. After logging a couple of days’ worth of data we looked at the graph and discovered the thermostat in zone two was calling for heat much more than it should. This allowed the homeowner to pinpoint the problem and correct the system, saving hundreds of dollars per month.</p>

                            	This was the final team project for my Intro to Engineering course first during my first year at UVA. Our assignment was to improve accessibility. During our initial audit we found the doors at UVA to be heavy and difficult to open, especially for a handicapped person. We decided to tackle this issue two ways. Through a recessed floor mounted button designed to be activated by a wheelchair wheel or crutch, but not feet, and through a mobile application which could remotely open doors. I was in charge of the circuit and software design. The floor button contained a series of switches which activated when pressed. These were wired into a Raspberry Pi Single Board computer. Code written in C on the raspberry pi then triggered the door opening mechanism. The Android app was developed in Java using Android Studio. Its interface was based on Google Maps, with a marker located over each door. When the marker was clicked on, another screen with an "open" button would appear. When this button was pressed a signal was sent to the raspberry pi and the corresponding door opener triggered. The location and data for each door was stored on an Amazon Webservices Database, and loaded each time the app was opened. Our project was featured in UVA today <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/students-do-not-become-engineers-sitting-lectures"> here</a>.
